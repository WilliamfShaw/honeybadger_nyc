every element(tags) we put dom are called "node"

manipulate these nodes (p, footer, header) - tags

works in a tree base structure. the dom start

.querySelector - pulls the 1st item found not all if you want all you must use
.querySelectorAll()

access what's inside the tags, tell me what's between the opening and closing tags --> innerHTML
editing contents of a node (tag), if i wanted to update the value of that key (heading.innterHTML) =

similar to:

var catName = "Lucy"
var catName = "Bobby"
