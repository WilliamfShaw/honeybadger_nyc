// If they say C ---> do the math to covert the temp to "C"

// Prompt the user for two inputs: a temperature, and a temperature scale they would like to convert 
// that temperature to.

// The options for temperature scales should be: `F to C or C to F`


// If you want to convert Celsius to Fahrenheit, just multiply the temperature by 1.8 and 
//then add 32 to the product. If you want to convert temperature from Fahrenheit to Celsius, 
//subtract 32 from the number and then divide the difference by 1.8
